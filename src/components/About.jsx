        <p className='mt-5 pb-8'>Josseph's Steak House was inspired by a labor of love to find the best possible beef and perfect the seemingly simple art of cooking steak. After five years of dreaming, planning, tasting and touring, we’re so happy to have arrived in the spiritual home of the steakhouse. Our menu revolves around all-natural beef from family-run farms, many based in upstate New York simply seasoned with flaked sea salt and seared over live-fire charcoal. <br/> <br/>
        Since first opening over fifteen years ago, Hawksmoor has become one of New York’s best loved restaurants, renowned for its dry-aged steaks, award-winning cocktails, consci entious approach to sourcing ingredients and industry-leading employment practices. </p>
